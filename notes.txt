    Next Release Notes
==========================================================================================

Cycle frequency increased from every 20 minutes to every 10 minutes

Industries now require you have the supplies needed to establish

Fixed "Cannot Stack Units" false alert
You're first claim now must be unowned
Other tweaks to first claim
Renamed cash crops to luxuries (It was confusing many users who expected them to generate cash)
Tweaked some trade language
Only private worlds allowed due to spam and nonsense, please contact goosepostbox@gmail.com if you believe your world will be active and would like it public.
Several other minor UI tweaks and minor bug fixes

Soon todo
Performance, scaling

    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)
