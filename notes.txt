    The Start Of A Nation
        Select a tile to start your nation. If available, select somewhere unclaimed.
    Start your people
        Establish a town
    Start your nation
        Establish a capitol industry
    Establishing a Charter
        Update your nation
    Change The Law
        Click on the Government menu. Set a Government, Tax Rate, and Ideology. Autocracy is great for early quick expansion. Keep your tax rates low so your support will regenerate quicker. Free Markets are a safer bet for new players.
    Feed the Masses
        Start a farm
    Power The People
        Have a source of energy
    Seize the Mean of Production
        Gather Timber, Fiber, and Ore, and create a manufacturing industry
    Manifest Destiny
        Capture new land. Toggle the unit display. Drag the unit on your Capitol unto an adjacent land square to capture it. This, and other unit actions, use up your political support, which replenishes every hour.
    Honest Work
        Assign a territory to farm.
    Sister Cities
        Create a new town.
    Industry
        Have your second city assigned an Industry. Obtaining and producing the right supplies is key to success.
    Enlist
        Enlist additional units. You may spawn them on your Capitol, or on any Military Industry settlement. Each has a Rock Paper Scissors style advantage on each other.
    Diplomacy
        Send a diplomatic request. Trade supplies for mutual benefit.
    Urban Life
        Establish a city
    Metropolitan
        Establish a metro
    My First Billion
        Become a billionaire
    It's Lonley at the Top

    Nuclear (Cash,Base,Aerospace,Uranium) = removes settlment

Tile considerations
    How it looks in street views (Avoiding incorrect labeling)
    How it looks from afar when most players use it (Avoiding line terrain tiles)
    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)

Unit Colors
    own: #739E82
    enemy: #AD343E
    ally: #2541B2
    neutral: #E0E0CE

Live Server Instance
    Change database connection in config/database.php
    Change encryption_key in config/config.php
    Change CRON token in config/constants.php and cron.php
    Modified column needs to be varchar during sql dumps because it is actually using MariaDB as stand-in, and has one timestamp column limitation
    Set a cron for 
        0 * * * * php -f /home/interpla/public_html/landgrab.xyz/application/cron.php

coord_slug
    coord_slug is top right corner of box

Map Size
    12x12 = 400
    6x6 = 2,000
    4x4 = 4,000
    3x3 = 7,000
    2x2 = 15,000
