Tile considerations
    How it looks in street views (Avoiding incorrect labeling)
    How it looks from afar when most players use it (Avoiding line terrain tiles)
    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)

Unit Colors
    own: #739E82
    enemy: #AD343E
    ally: #2541B2

Live Server Instance
    Change database connection in config/database.php
    Change encryption_key in config/config.php
    Change CRON token in config/constants.php and cron.php
    Modified column needs to be varchar during sql dumps because it is actually using MariaDB as stand-in, and has one timestamp column limitation
    Set a cron for 
        0 * * * * php -f /home/interpla/public_html/landgrab.xyz/application/cron.php

coord_slug
    coord_slug is top right corner of box
