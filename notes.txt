Tile considerations
    How it looks in street views (Avoiding incorrect labeling)
    How it looks from afar when most players use it (Avoiding line terrain tiles)
    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)

Unit Colors
    own: #739E82
    enemy: #AD343E
    ally: #2541B2

    Set a cron for 
        0 * * * * php -f /home/interpla/public_html/landgrab.xyz/application/cron.php
