Trade
    war/peace/passage (war doesn't require acceptance, peace is not enforced, passage is unless war)

Corruption
    Each n land tiles increases corruption by 1 percent, or something

Military Mechanics
    Infantry < Tanks < Commandos < Infantry
    On Ocean, all units become Navy with equal fighting chances
    Moves 1 tile in 4 directions, each attack costs 5 support, 50% chance of victory on sea square, 10% chance of victory taking a coast

Support
    Maxes out at 100(200 for socialism)
    Following does not stack
    Moving: 1 Support
    Landgrab: 4 support
    Attack Unit: 8 support
    Capture Town: 10 support
    Capture City: 30 support
    Capture Metro: 30 support
    Socialism Spawn Unit: 40 support
    Declare War: 50 support

Unit Battle Logic
    Infantry have 3/4 chance of victory against Commandos
    Commandos have 3/4 chance of victory against Tanks
    Tanks have 3/4 chance of victory against Infantry
    When on ocean, all units becomes Navy and have equal chances
    Towns get double defensive bonus
    Cities get triple defensive bonus
    Metros get quadruple defensive bonus

Budget Rates
    Tax (Support) = Cash as Percent of GDP

Tutorial Todo List
    The Start Of A Nation
        Select a tile to start your nation. If available, select somewhere unclaimed.
    I'm Just A Bill
        Click on the Government menu. Set a Government, Tax Rate, and Ideology. Autocracy is great for early quick expansion. Keep your tax rates low so your support will regenerate quicker. Free Markets are a safer bet for new players.
    Manifest Destiny
        Capture new land. Toggle the unit display. Drag the unit on your Capitol unto an adjacent land square to capture it. This, and other unit actions, use up your political support, which replenishes every hour.
    Honest work
        Assign a territory to farm.
    Sister Cities
        Create a second town.
    Industry
        Have your second city assigned an Industry. Obtaining and producing the right supplies is key to success.
    Enlist
        Enlist additional units. You may spawn them on your Capitol, or on any Military Industry settlement. Each has a Rock Paper Scissors style advantage on each other.
    Diplomacy
        Send a diplomatic request. Trade supplies for mutual benefit.

Creating a town requires and uses 1 food immediately

Tile considerations
    How it looks in street views (Avoiding incorrect labeling)
    How it looks from afar when most players use it (Avoiding line terrain tiles)
    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)

Live Server Instance
    Change database connection in config/database.php
    Change encryption_key in config/config.php
    Change CRON token in config/constants.php and cron.php
    Modified column needs to be varchar during sql dumps because it is actually using MariaDB as stand-in, and has one timestamp column limitation
    Set a cron for
