    Notes
==========================================================================================

before output functions are run
shortages
each 1 under supply count costs 1 support
when below 0 support, government switched to anarchy before output functions are run
no industry outputs, no gdp

tax mechanic?

exploit? trade all supplies, spend all money on troops, convert to socialism, use support for more troops

Hourly Cron Sequence
    Pay for settlements
    Pay for industry
    Receive settlements output
    Receive industry output
    Use up auto used supplies

Power Structure
    Democracy Corruption at 20%, 2 support per minute
    Oligarchy Corruption at 40%, 4 support per minute
    Autocracy Corruption at 60%, 5 support per minute

Support
    Maxes out at 100(200 for Socialism?)
    Following does not stack
    Moving: 1 Support
    Capture Land: 5 Support
    Capture Town: 10 Support
    Capture City: 20 Support
    Capture Metro: 30 Support
    Socialism Spawn Unit: 50 Support
    Declare War: 50 Support
    Passing Laws: 50 Support
    Moving Capitol: 100 Support

Unit Battle Logic
    Infantry have 3/4 chance of victory against Commandos
    Commandos have 3/4 chance of victory against Tanks
    Tanks have 3/4 chance of victory against Infantry
    All have 3/4 chance of victory against Navy
    All have 3/4 chance of victory against Militia
    Undefended tiles have 1/4 chance of spawning militia
    On ocean, all units becomes Navy
    Mountains get double defensive bonus
    Tundra get double defensive bonus
    Barren gets double offensive bonus
    Towns get double defensive bonus
    Cities get triple defensive bonus
    Metros get quadruple defensive bonus

Population Increase
    Town: 1 per hour
    City: 10 per hour
    Metro: 30 per hour

Budget Rates
    Tax (Support) = Cash as Percent of GDP
    Affects rate of support increase, can become negative

Tutorial Todo List
    The Start Of A Nation
        Select a tile to start your nation. If available, select somewhere unclaimed.
    Change The Law
        Click on the Government menu. Set a Government, Tax Rate, and Ideology. Autocracy is great for early quick expansion. Keep your tax rates low so your support will regenerate quicker. Free Markets are a safer bet for new players.
    Manifest Destiny
        Capture new land. Toggle the unit display. Drag the unit on your Capitol unto an adjacent land square to capture it. This, and other unit actions, use up your political support, which replenishes every hour.
    Honest Work
        Assign a territory to farm.
    Sister Cities
        Create a new town.
    Industry
        Have your second city assigned an Industry. Obtaining and producing the right supplies is key to success.
    Enlist
        Enlist additional units. You may spawn them on your Capitol, or on any Military Industry settlement. Each has a Rock Paper Scissors style advantage on each other.
    Diplomacy
        Send a diplomatic request. Trade supplies for mutual benefit.

Tagline
    Economy, Diplomacy, Warfare
    Harvest, Trade, and War

Attacks
    Spy (Cash) = reveals all units of other player
    Bombing (Cash,Base,Aerospace) = removes unit
    Nuclear (Cash,Base,Aerospace,Uranium) = removes settlment

Tile considerations
    How it looks in street views (Avoiding incorrect labeling)
    How it looks from afar when most players use it (Avoiding line terrain tiles)
    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)

Terms of use
    I do not enforce rules I'm unable to properly enforce.

Live Server Instance
    Change database connection in config/database.php
    Change encryption_key in config/config.php
    Change CRON token in config/constants.php and cron.php
    Modified column needs to be varchar during sql dumps because it is actually using MariaDB as stand-in, and has one timestamp column limitation
    Set a cron for 
        0 * * * * php -f /home/interpla/public_html/landgrab.xyz/application/cron.php

coord_slug
    coord_slug is top right corner of box

Map Size
    12x12 = 400
    6x6 = 2,000
    4x4 = 4,000
    3x3 = 7,000
    2x2 = 15,000
