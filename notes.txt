Tutorial Todo List
    The Start Of A Nation
        Select a tile to start your nation. If available, select somewhere unclaimed.
    Change The Law
        Click on the Government menu. Set a Government, Tax Rate, and Ideology. Autocracy is great for early quick expansion. Keep your tax rates low so your support will regenerate quicker. Free Markets are a safer bet for new players.
    Manifest Destiny
        Capture new land. Toggle the unit display. Drag the unit on your Capitol unto an adjacent land square to capture it. This, and other unit actions, use up your political support, which replenishes every hour.
    Honest Work
        Assign a territory to farm.
    Sister Cities
        Create a new town.
    Industry
        Have your second city assigned an Industry. Obtaining and producing the right supplies is key to success.
    Enlist
        Enlist additional units. You may spawn them on your Capitol, or on any Military Industry settlement. Each has a Rock Paper Scissors style advantage on each other.
    Diplomacy
        Send a diplomatic request. Trade supplies for mutual benefit.

Tagline
    Economy, Diplomacy, Warfare
    Harvest, Trade, and War

Attacks
    Spy (Cash) = reveals all units of other player
    Bombing (Cash,Base,Aerospace) = removes unit
    Nuclear (Cash,Base,Aerospace,Uranium) = removes settlment

Tile considerations
    How it looks in street views (Avoiding incorrect labeling)
    How it looks from afar when most players use it (Avoiding line terrain tiles)
    Population density (Considering max settlement for the square)
    Overlap between other tiles (coastal mountain, do I want to allow farming on this square?)

Terms of use
    I do not enforce rules I'm unable to properly enforce.

Live Server Instance
    Change database connection in config/database.php
    Change encryption_key in config/config.php
    Change CRON token in config/constants.php and cron.php
    Modified column needs to be varchar during sql dumps because it is actually using MariaDB as stand-in, and has one timestamp column limitation
    Set a cron for 
        0 * * * * php -f /home/interpla/public_html/landgrab.xyz/application/cron.php

coord_slug
    coord_slug is top right corner of box

Map Size
    12x12 = 400
    6x6 = 2,000
    4x4 = 4,000
    3x3 = 7,000
    2x2 = 15,000
